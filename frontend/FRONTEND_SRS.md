# Software Requirements Specification: YouTube Video Management Frontend (MVP)

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose
This Software Requirements Specification (SRS) document describes the functional and non-functional requirements for the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) of the YouTube Video Management Frontend application. This application provides the user interface for the backend API service, adhering to the `frontend/UI_SYSTEM_DESIGN.md`.

### 1.2 Document Conventions
"Shall" denotes a mandatory requirement. "Should" denotes a desirable feature. "May" denotes an optional feature.

### 1.3 Intended Audience and Reading Suggestions
This document is for project stakeholders, developers (especially frontend), testers, and project managers. Familiarity with the Frontend PRD (`frontend/FRONTEND_PRD.md`), UI System Design (`frontend/UI_SYSTEM_DESIGN.md`), and general web application concepts is recommended.

### 1.4 Project Scope
The scope is to deliver a React-based frontend application enabling users to interact with the YouTube Video Management backend. Key functionalities include user authentication, viewing API connection status, and performing CRUD operations on YouTube videos, using predefined UI components and patterns.

## 2. Overall Description

### 2.1 Product Perspective
The YouTube Video Management Frontend is a client application for the existing backend API. It's a new, standalone single-page application (SPA) built according to the UI System Design.

### 2.2 Product Features (Frontend Focus)
*   User Authentication UIs: `Signup Form`, `Login Form`, Logout functionality (e.g., `Button` in `App Header`).
*   Display of YouTube API Connection Status (e.g., in `App Header`).
*   UI for Listing Videos using `Video Card / List Item` components and `Pagination Control`.
*   UI for Viewing Detailed Video Information in a `Video Detail Display` section.
*   UI for Editing Video Metadata via `Video Metadata Form` (Page or `Modal`).
*   UI for Uploading New Videos via `Video Metadata Form` (Page or `Modal`).
*   UI for Deleting Videos, including a `Confirmation Modal`.
*   Responsive design as per UI System Design's layout system and breakpoints.
*   User feedback mechanisms: `Spinner/Loader` atoms, `Notification/Toast` system.

### 2.3 User Classes and Characteristics
*   **Authenticated User:** The primary user, who has logged in to the application. They interact with the UI to manage videos associated with the backend's pre-configured YouTube channel. Expected to be familiar with standard web interfaces.

### 2.4 Operating Environment
*   **Client-side:** Modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge) with JavaScript enabled.
*   **Frameworks/Libraries:** React 19, Vite, React Router, Tailwind CSS.
*   No specific client hardware requirements beyond what's needed for a modern web browser.

### 2.5 Design and Implementation Constraints
*   Shall be developed as a Single Page Application (SPA) using React 19 and Vite.
*   Shall use React Router for client-side navigation.
*   Shall use Tailwind CSS for styling, following conventions in `UI_SYSTEM_DESIGN.md`.
*   Shall adhere to Clean Architecture principles adapted for frontend development.
*   UI components and patterns shall conform to `frontend/UI_SYSTEM_DESIGN.md`.
*   All interactions with the backend shall be via the documented RESTful API (JSON).
*   State management shall be implemented using appropriate React patterns or libraries.
*   Sensitive information (like tokens, if directly handled by frontend post-login) must be stored securely (e.g., HttpOnly cookies managed by backend, or secure browser storage if necessary and appropriate). For MVP, session is primarily backend-managed via cookies.

### 2.6 Assumptions and Dependencies
*   The backend YouTube Video Management API is functional, available, and conforms to its SRS.
*   The user has a compatible web browser and internet connectivity.
*   The backend handles YouTube API credentials and interactions securely.

## 4. External Interface Requirements (Frontend Perspective)

### 4.1 User Interfaces (This Application)
*   The application itself is a User Interface. It shall be graphical and web-based.
*   It shall be responsive, adapting to desktop, tablet, and mobile screen sizes as per `UI_SYSTEM_DESIGN.md`.

### 4.2 Software Interfaces
*   **Backend API:** The frontend shall interact with the YouTube Video Management backend API as defined in its SRS and the `frontend/FRONTEND_BACKLOG.md` (for DTOs).
    *   Communication protocol: HTTP/S.
    *   Data format: JSON.
*   **Web Browser APIs:** The frontend will utilize standard web browser APIs for rendering, HTTP requests (Fetch API or Axios), routing (History API via React Router), and potentially local storage if used for non-sensitive UI preferences.

## 5. Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs)

### 5.1 Performance Requirements
*   **NFR-FE-001 (Page Load Time):** Initial application load (scripts, core assets) should be reasonably fast, aiming for Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) within 2.5 seconds on a good connection. Subsequent page transitions should feel near-instant.
*   **NFR-FE-002 (API Response Handling):** UI should remain responsive while waiting for API calls. `Spinner/Loader` atoms shall be displayed for operations expected to take more than 500ms.
*   **NFR-FE-003 (List Rendering):** `Video List/Grid` of videos (e.g., 20 items per page) should render efficiently. Consider virtualization for very long scrollable lists if they become a feature.

### 5.2 Security (Frontend Aspects)
*   **NFR-FE-004 (Data Handling):** No sensitive data (like raw passwords after submission, or persistent API tokens if not using backend HttpOnly cookies) should be stored insecurely in client-side scripts or local storage.
*   **NFR-FE-005 (Cross-Site Scripting - XSS):** React's default data binding helps prevent XSS, but care must be taken if using `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` or injecting content from API without sanitization (though API content is assumed to be from YouTube or user-input and managed).
*   **NFR-FE-006 (API Communication):** All API calls to the backend shall be made over HTTPS if the backend is deployed with HTTPS.

### 5.3 Usability
*   **NFR-FE-007 (Learnability):** The UI shall be intuitive and easy for new users to learn.
*   **NFR-FE-008 (Consistency):** UI elements, terminology, and interaction patterns shall be consistent throughout the application, as per `UI_SYSTEM_DESIGN.md`.
*   **NFR-FE-009 (Feedback):** The system shall provide clear feedback for user actions (e.g., `Notification/Toast` system, `Spinner/Loader` atoms).
*   **NFR-FE-010 (Accessibility - A11y):** The UI should follow WCAG 2.1 Level AA guidelines where feasible for MVP, including specifics in `UI_SYSTEM_DESIGN.md` (Keyboard navigability, Semantic HTML, ARIA attributes).

### 5.4 Reliability
*   **NFR-FE-011 (Error Handling):** The frontend shall gracefully handle API errors or unexpected responses, displaying user-friendly messages (e.g., via the `Notification/Toast` system) instead of crashing or showing raw error data.
*   **NFR-FE-012 (State Management):** Application state shall be managed reliably, ensuring UI consistency.

### 5.5 Maintainability
*   **NFR-FE-013 (Code Quality):** Code shall be well-structured, commented where necessary, and follow React/JavaScript best practices. Adherence to Clean Architecture principles.
*   **NFR-FE-014 (Componentization):** UI shall be built using reusable, well-defined React components as specified or inspired by `UI_SYSTEM_DESIGN.md`.
*   **NFR-FE-015 (Testability):** Components and logic (hooks, services) shall be designed for unit and integration testing.

### 5.6 Portability
*   **NFR-FE-016 (Browser Compatibility):** The application shall function correctly on the latest stable versions of major web browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).
