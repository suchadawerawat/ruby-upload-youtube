# Product Requirements Document: YouTube Video Management Frontend (MVP)

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) of the YouTube Video Management Frontend application. This application will serve as the user interface for the backend API service, allowing users to manage their YouTube videos. The frontend will be built using React 19, Vite, React Router, and Tailwind CSS, adhering to Clean Architecture principles and an established UI System Design.

## 2. Goals and Objectives

*   **Primary Goal:** Provide an intuitive and responsive user interface for users to interact with the YouTube Video Management backend API, enabling them to perform basic CRUD operations on their YouTube videos, following the defined UI System Design.
*   **MVP Objective 1:** Implement a user-friendly interface for listing, viewing details, editing metadata, uploading, and deleting YouTube videos, utilizing components like `Video Card` and `Video Metadata Form`.
*   **MVP Objective 2:** Enable secure user authentication (signup, logout) via `Signup Form` and `Login Form` components, and manage session state.
*   **MVP Objective 3:** Clearly display the connection status to the backend YouTube API, potentially within the `App Header`.
*   **MVP Objective 4:** Ensure the frontend is responsive and provides a good user experience on common devices (desktop, tablet, mobile), as per UI System Design guidelines.
*   **MVP Objective 5:** Develop the frontend following Clean Architecture principles and the UI System Design to ensure maintainability, scalability, and testability.

## 3. Target Audience

*   **MVP User:** A single administrator/user who uses the backend API's pre-configured YouTube account credentials. This user interacts with the frontend to manage their own YouTube channel videos.
*   **Technical Comfort:** Users are expected to be comfortable with web applications but do not need deep technical knowledge of APIs.

## 4. Proposed Features (MVP)

### 4.1. User Authentication UI
*   **4.1.1. Signup Page:** Allows a new user to create an account using the `Signup Form` organism.
    *   Inputs: Email, Password.
    *   Feedback: Success or error messages, potentially via `Notification/Toast` components.
*   **4.1.2. Login Page:** Allows an existing user to log in using the `Login Form` organism.
    *   Inputs: Email, Password.
    *   Feedback: Success (redirect to video list/dashboard) or error messages, potentially via `Notification/Toast` components.
*   **4.1.3. Logout Functionality:** Allows an authenticated user to log out, typically via a `Button` in the `App Header`.
    *   Action: Clears session, redirects to login.

### 4.2. YouTube Connection Status Display
*   **4.2.1. Connection Status Indicator:** Visually informs the user if the backend is successfully connected to the configured YouTube account and displays the channel name if available. This will likely be part of the `App Header`.

### 4.3. Core Video Management UI
*   **4.3.1. List Videos Page:**
    *   Displays a paginated list of videos from the connected YouTube channel, using `Video Card / List Item` components within a `Video List/Grid`.
    *   Key information per video: Thumbnail, Title, Views, Publication Date.
    *   Action: Link from each `Video Card` to view video details. Includes `Pagination Control`.
*   **4.3.2. View Video Details Page:**
    *   Displays comprehensive details for a selected video using a `Video Detail Display` section.
    *   Actions: Links/buttons to edit metadata or delete the video.
*   **4.3.3. Edit Video Metadata UI (Page or Modal):**
    *   Allows users to update a video's Title, Description, Tags, Category, and Privacy Status, typically using a `Video Metadata Form`.
    *   Inputs: Form fields for editable metadata.
    *   Feedback: Success or error messages, potentially via `Notification/Toast` components.
*   **4.3.4. Upload New Video UI (Page or Modal):**
    *   Allows users to upload a video file along with its initial metadata (Title, Description, Tags, Category, Privacy Status), using a `Video Metadata Form` adapted for upload.
    *   Inputs: File selector, form fields for metadata.
    *   Feedback: Upload progress (optional), success or error messages via `Notification/Toast`.
*   **4.3.5. Delete Video Functionality:**
    *   Allows users to delete a video from their YouTube channel.
    *   Action: Requires confirmation before deletion, using a `Confirmation Modal`.
    *   Feedback: Success or error messages via `Notification/Toast`; UI updates accordingly (e.g., video removed from list).

### 4.4. General UI/UX
*   **4.4.1. Responsive Design:** The application layout adapts to different screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile), as guided by the UI System Design's layout system.
*   **4.4.2. Error Handling & Notifications:** Clear, user-friendly messages for API errors, validation errors, or other issues, presented via the `Notification/Toast` system.
*   **4.4.3. Loading States:** Visual indicators (e.g., `Spinner/Loader` atoms) when data is being fetched or operations are in progress.
*   **4.4.4. Basic Accessibility:** Adherence to A11y best practices (e.g., semantic HTML, keyboard navigation) as outlined in the UI System Design.

## 5. Design and Technical Approach (Summary)

*   **Framework/Libraries:** React 19, Vite, React Router, Tailwind CSS.
*   **Architecture:** Clean Architecture principles, focusing on separation of concerns (UI components, application logic/hooks/services, domain/types).
*   **UI System Design:** Development will adhere to `frontend/UI_SYSTEM_DESIGN.md` for components, styling, and patterns.
*   **API Interaction:** All backend interactions via the RESTful JSON API provided by the YouTube Video Management backend service.
*   **State Management:** Appropriate React state management solution (e.g., Context API, Zustand, Redux Toolkit) to manage application state, including authentication status and fetched data.
*   **Routing:** Client-side routing managed by React Router.

## 6. Success Metrics (MVP)

*   Users can successfully sign up, log in, and log out.
*   Users can clearly see the YouTube API connection status.
*   Users can list, view, edit metadata, upload, and delete videos through the UI.
*   The UI is responsive and functions correctly on major browsers and device types.
*   The frontend codebase adheres to the defined Clean Architecture principles, UI System Design, and is well-tested.

## 7. Future Considerations (Post-MVP)

*   Full OAuth 2.0 flow for dynamic YouTube account linking via the UI.
*   Multi-user support with individual account management.
*   Advanced video management features (e.g., batch operations, playlist management, analytics display).
*   Enhanced search and filtering for videos.
*   Real-time updates or notifications (e.g., using WebSockets if backend supports).
*   More comprehensive accessibility features.
*   Internationalization (i18n) and localization (l10n).

## 8. Out of Scope for MVP

*   Dynamic, user-initiated YouTube account linking (relies on pre-configured backend).
*   Support for multiple user accounts beyond the single admin user.
*   Advanced video analytics or playlist management.
*   Real-time features beyond basic loading/feedback.
*   Offline support.
